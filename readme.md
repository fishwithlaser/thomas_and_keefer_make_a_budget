to create (and reset) the database run:
`python3 -m database reset`

except now it will create an empty database lol 

to process data run:
`python3 -m process read`

make sure you make an input folder too! 
`mkdir input`. I should make that for you and check it into git, but my local one is so full of googies!! Sorry!!
